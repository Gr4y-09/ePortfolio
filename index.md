# 👋 Hi, I'm Nanelle!
### Aspiring Web Developer | Future Full-Stack Engineer 🚀

I’m a 3rd-year IT student who loves the idea of building applications that solve real-world problems. My journey started with a curiosity about how websites are made and a strategic goal to avoid board exams, but it turned into a passion for clean and efficient code, logical database design, and user friendly projects for all technological background.
