# 👋 Hi, I'm Nanelle Tuguinay
### Aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer | Pattern-Seeking Logician | 3rd Year IT Student 🚀
📍 Metro Manila, Philippines | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nanelle-tuguinay/) | nanelle.tuguinay@my.jru.edu

I am a 3rd-year IT student dedicated to architecting digital solutions that bridge the gap between complex logic and everyday utility. What began as a curiosity about web architecture and a strategic move to focus on skill-based mastery over board exams has evolved into a deep-seated passion for clean, efficient code and relational database design. I thrive on building projects that remain accessible to users of all technological backgrounds, ensuring that high-level functionality never comes at the cost of a seamless experience.

### 🧩 Beyond the Code
When I'm not debugging, you can find me:
* **Technical Identity:** **INTP-T** (Logician). I approach code as a puzzle, using my background as an **ear-trained musician** (Keys/Bass) to recognize and implement complex logical patterns.
* **Strategy & Logic:** I'm an avid **Minesweeper** player, I love games that challenge my brain during small breaks.
* **Creative Arts:** I enjoy the patience and detail of **crocheting**, **cross-stitching**, and playing my **acoustic guitar**.
* **Community & Play:** I play **Badminton** to stay active and enjoy **TTRPGs** and story-driven games with friends online.
