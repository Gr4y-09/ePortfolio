# 👋 Hi, I'm Nanelle Tuguinay

### Aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer | Pattern-Seeking Logician | 3rd Year IT Student 🚀
📍 Metro Manila, Philippines | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nanelle-tuguinay/) | nanelle.tuguinay@my.jru.edu

As an aspiring IT Architect the bridging the complexity of logic to utility through digital solution design is one of my passions. During my 3 years of IT studies, my curiosity for web architecture turned into my passion for clean code and efficient design of relational databases. I enjoy working on projects that simplify access to users of all, without compromising on functionalities, and with a great experience.
